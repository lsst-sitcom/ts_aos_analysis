# Project Notebooks

This repository contains different types of notebooks, categorized by their purpose and the type of tests they are associated with. Below is a breakdown of the contents and structure of the `notebooks` folder.

## Folder Structure

- **json_blocks/**  
  This folder contains notebooks used to generate configurable JSON blocks. These JSON blocks are used in various configurations for the tests and operations within the project.

- **WET/**  
  Notebooks related to the **WET (Write Execution Tests)**. These tests are designed to validate the functionality of writing data and ensuring proper execution flows within the system.

- **ASCt/**  
  Notebooks related to **ASCt (Active System Configuration tests)**. These tests focus on checking the configuration of active systems, ensuring they adhere to expected settings and behavior.

- **LUTT/**  
  Notebooks for **LUTT (Lookup Table Tests)**. These tests are designed to verify that the lookup tables used in the system function as expected and return correct values under different scenarios.

- **CLT/**  
  Notebooks related to **CLT (Control Logic Tests)**. These tests ensure that the control logic implemented in the system is functioning correctly and handling edge cases appropriately.

## Usage

- Each folder is self-contained with relevant notebooks for their specific purpose.
- The **json_blocks/** folder generates configuration JSON files used across the different test types.
- For detailed instructions on running the tests or generating JSON configurations, refer to the individual notebooks in each folder.

## Contribution

- Please follow the folder structure and naming conventions when adding new notebooks.
- Ensure that any new notebooks are clearly documented within the notebook itself and in this README if they introduce new functionality or test types.
